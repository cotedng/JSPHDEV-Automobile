- Driver.java contains a main function that tests the functionality of BuildAuto API with two different models and options selection.

- JUnit test cases are in the test package to test the related java files.

- I created two input test files FocusWagonZTW.txt and TeslaSModel.txt.

- FocusWagonZTW_wrong_price is for testing exception handling and fix method.

- Filename exception and negative price can be self-healing.
